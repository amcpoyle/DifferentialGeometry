# Differential Geometry
Repository of code I have used for visualizing/computing differential geometry during Spring 2026 term. Some of this code is computational functions for computing curvature, torsion, plotting curves and surfaces, etc. Other parts of this repo are for creating animations and visuals using manimgl. I have added some small example clips of these animations.
